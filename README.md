## Crime Statistics in Seattle
For our project, we decided to look at the crime statistics in Seattle from 2008 - present. Our interactive application is intended for anyone who might be interested in seeing how the crime rates have changed over time in the Seattle area.

## Interaction
The user can manipulate the data by selecting how they want to view the data. By using the provided widgets, the user can decide whether to view crimes in all years, crimes in all months of a specific year or crimes in all precincts of a specific year. They can also filter the visualization by selecting the crime types they want to remove. The user can also click on tabs that provide more information on the data.

## Our Data Set
We obtained our data set from [_data.seattle.gov_](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Crime-Stats-by-Police-Precinct-2008-Presen/3xqu-vnum). It was last updated in February, 2017, so the information on our interactive application is pretty relevant to our users.

## Approach
For this project, creating branches was not an option. In order to tackle this, we had to work in stages, so we divided the project in that manner. One person worked on wrangling the data, creating the necessary data frames. The next person worked on the visualization, deciding what was the appropriate way to interpret our data. After that we had someone transfer the visualizations and data frames onto a shiny app, they also created widgets and made it interactive. Finally we had someone work on polishing the final product, they added paragraphs, design features and other final touches.
