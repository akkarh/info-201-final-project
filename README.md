## Crime Statistics in Seattle
For our project, we decided to look at the crime statistics in Seattle from 2008 - present. Our interactive application is intended for anyone who might be interested in seeing how the crime rates have changed over time in the Seattle area.

## Our Data Set
We obtained our data set from [_data.seattle.gov_](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Crime-Stats-by-Police-Precinct-2008-Presen/3xqu-vnum). It was last updated in February, 2017, so the information on our interactive application is pretty relevant to our users.
